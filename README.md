# Overview
Multimodal-AI-App-using-Llava-7B is an AI-powered voice assistant that allows users to interact with images through voice commands. By providing an image and asking questions via recorded audio, the assistant processes the input to generate responses in both text and audio formats. This project leverages the power of the Llava-7B model, a state-of-the-art multimodal AI, to understand and analyze visual content, providing accurate and context-aware answers.
